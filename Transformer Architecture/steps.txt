Explanation
Logging Configuration:

Configures logging to output to a file named transformer_steps.log with the INFO level and a specific message format including the timestamp, log level, and message content.
Dataset Definition:

Defines a small dataset and logs its content.
Finding Vocabulary Size:

Breaks the dataset into words, finds unique words, calculates the vocabulary size, and logs the results.
Encoding:

Assigns a unique index to each word, encodes the dataset based on this mapping, and logs the encoded dataset.
Calculating Embedding:

Creates a random embedding matrix, embeds a sample sentence, and logs the results.
Calculating Positional Embedding:

Computes positional embeddings for the sentence and logs them.
Concatenating Embeddings:

Concatenates word and positional embeddings and logs the result.
Multi-Head Attention:

Performs scaled dot-product attention using the concatenated embeddings and logs the attention output and weights.
Adding and Normalizing:

Normalizes the attention output and logs the results.
Feed Forward Network:

Applies a simple feedforward network to the normalized output and logs the results.
Adding and Normalizing Again:

Normalizes the output after the feedforward network and logs the results.
Decoder Part:

Simulates masked multi-head attention for the decoder part and logs the attention output.
Understanding Masked Multi-Head Attention:

Provides an example of masked attention, computes a combined output, and logs the results.
Calculating the Predicted Word:

Calculates a simplified prediction using logits, finds the predicted word, and logs it.
Conclusion:

Logs the conclusion of the explanation.
Running the Code
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the current directory.
Run the code in a Python environment that supports file I/O operations.
After running the code, you can check transformer_steps.log for detailed log messages at each step.
